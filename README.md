### Testing User Expeerience UX
As a visitor to the website:

I want to easily navigate through the website to find information about fitness programs and resources.

Upon their initial visit, new users will encounter a navigation menu bar, providing them with the option to explore the website, including the main home page. As they scroll down, they will discover a comprehensive 'About Us' section, offering additional information about the company's offerings for those seeking to enhance their health and fitness. Next to the 'About Us' segment, a dedicated review section features comments from other customers sharing their experiences with the site.
